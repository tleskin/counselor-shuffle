## Counselor Shuffle

This app was created for the counselors at Westminster High School to allow the
secretary to know when a counselor is available to see another student.

The app utilizes Node.js and Websockets. To run the project, run
<code>node app.js</code> and visit http://localhost:8080 in the browser.
